	  <h1>Keep your data safe with <strong>Grid403</strong> — without the tech hassle</h1>
	  <p>Imagine a smart guard that watches your digital doors 24/7, not to stop every visitor, but to quietly catch the ones who don’t belong.<br>That’s what our service does — and you don’t need to know anything about computers to use it.</p>
	  <p>We help you set up a simple, advanced “trap” (called a honeypot) that quietly waits for hackers trying to guess passwords or break into your systems.<br>If someone tries, the trap catches them — without putting your real data at risk.</p>

	  <h2>What makes it special?</h2>
	  <ul>
		  <li><strong>No tech skills</strong> needed: we handle everything. Just click a few buttons, and you’re protected.</li>
		  <li>You help <strong>protect others</strong>: when someone tries to hack your system, we anonymously share details (like the hacker’s IP address) with a trusted network.</li>
		  <li>This helps <strong>build a global</strong> “no-entry” list for firewalls so everyone stays safer.</li>
		  <li><strong>Privacy</strong> first: we never share your personal data. Data is handled with care and respect. For example passwords collected and present in our wordlist will never be associated to any account with the only execption of default user accounts like for example administrator (without relative domain name) or root</li>
		  <li>It’s like having a silent <strong>watchdog</strong> that helps you and the community stay safe — all without slowing you down or complicating your life.</li>

		  <li><strong>Protect</strong> your data and help others. All in a few simple steps.</li>
	  </ul>
